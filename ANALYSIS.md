####Time Review
* Because I heard the first project is not as easy as other classes's first project, I started it two days before school starts. In total, I spent approximately 26 hours in two and a half weeks on this project. 
* The first few days (day 1-3), I was brainstorming about which game genre I'm going to use. It is not hard for me to decide on making a puzzle game, since I'm a huge fan of puzzle games, both 2D indie games like _Braid_ and 3D puzzle games like _Portal_ and _Talo's Principle_. After settling on a genre, I spent some time (day 4-5) considering what features I'm going to include in this game and its approximate length. That is the time I started and finished DESIGN.txt. Next, I began coding. Based on the Professor Duvall's example "game", I figured I could use 80% of his Main class with just a little change, so the main class doesn't take long. I began writing the game class by starting the _init_ method, and some teaching levels. 

I used another week to implement the game. The first few days are simply setting up the skeleton for the game setup class and getting started on the “soul”, the Portal class.
