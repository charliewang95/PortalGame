Genre: Puzzle
Name (temporary): Impasse
Background: The game is inspired by one of Valve's best selling first person shooting game: Portal (and, of course, Portal 2), except this game will be 2D with different features than just portals (and less difficult...). 
	The puzzles will look hard at first, but after a few levels, the player will get some idea (tricks) about how the game should go.
	The name "Impasse" shows the nature of this game: you may find yourself out of road some time. 
Goal: Navigate a ball across a map to reach a certain destination by transporting through portals. 
Mechanics: A maze with walls (or at least it kinds of looks like one) will show on the screen. Initially, the target (likely a ball) is at some place in this maze, and by pressing keys, 
	we move the ball accordingly. The ball cannot pass through the black walls.
	There will be portals on the wall for the target to pass through, and by passing through the portal, other incidents will happen. 
	The main incident that will happen is that the doors of the same color will change visibility each time the player passes through a portal.
	That is, open doors will close and closed doors will open. This may change the possibility whether the player can navigate through a certain path.
	
	Other features may include: an additional wall will arise each time the target goes through a portal.
	Alternatively, some grids will disappear or reappear when the target goes through a portal. There could be multiple pairs of portals on the walls.
	I'm still brainstorming about more features to add to increase the difficulty as the game goes on.
# of levels: The plan is to make at least 5 levels. Each level (or each 2 level) will upgrade the difficulty. I have already made 4 levels.
